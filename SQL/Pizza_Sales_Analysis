# üçï Pizza Sales Analysis | SQL Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes pizza sales data for a Pizza Hut outlet to identify top-selling pizzas, best-performing categories, popular sizes, and peak sales hours. Data from 4 Excel sources (Orders ‚Äì 21K+, Order Details ‚Äì 48K+, Pizzas ‚Äì 97, Pizza Type ‚Äì 33) was imported into MySQL for structured analysis.
