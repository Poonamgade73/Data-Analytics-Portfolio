# üí∞ Crowdfunding Analysis

## üìò Project Overview

Crowdfunding has become one of the most popular methods for raising capital for innovative ideas. However, a large percentage of projects fail to reach their funding goals because creators often lack insights into what drives success ‚Äî such as **goal amount, duration, category, and region**.

This project analyzes **365K+ crowdfunding campaigns** to uncover key factors influencing success, failure, and overall funding trends.
The goal is to help **creators, investors, and platforms** make more data-driven decisions and improve campaign outcomes.

## üßπ Data Preparation & Transformation

### üßÆ Preprocessing Steps

1. **Converted Epoch Time ‚Üí Natural Date**

   * Transformed timestamp fields (like `Created Date`) from *Epoch format* to standard *DateTime* format.
   * Reference: [Epoch Converter](https://www.epochconverter.com/)
   * Video followed: [Epoch Conversion Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi0rPOly2IA)

2. **Built a Calendar Table using the Created Date column**
   Generated dates ranging from **minimum to maximum project creation dates** and added the following derived fields:

   * **Year**
   * **Month Number**
   * **Month Full Name**
   * **Quarter (Q1‚ÄìQ4)**
   * **Year-Month (YYYY-MMM)**
   * **Weekday Number**
   * **Weekday Name**
   * **Financial Month** (April = FM1, May = FM2 ‚Ä¶ March = FM12)
   * **Financial Quarter** (FQ1, FQ2, FQ3, FQ4)

3. **Converted Goal Amounts to USD**

   * Applied a **static USD conversion rate** to standardize funding goals across all currencies.

4. **Cleaned and Standardized Data**

   * Removed duplicates and handled null values.
   * Validated category mappings and project outcomes.

5. **Built Data Model**

   * Established relationships between **Fact (Projects)** and **Dimension (Category, Location, Creator, Calendar)** tables using **primary‚Äìforeign key relationships** in Power BI/Tableau.
